# 50-days-of-sfdc-development-r1
This repo is for keeping track of my initial learning stage of Salesforce Development. Throughout the course of 50 days, I will be learning Fundamentals of Apex, Apex Classes, Triggers, Test Classes, SOQL and SOSL. Any code that write to practice will be pushed on to this repo.
